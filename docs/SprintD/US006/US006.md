# US6: DGS wants to record daily the total number of people vaccinated in each vaccination center

## 1. Requirements Engineering
### 1.1. User Story Description

DGS wants to record daily the total number of people vaccinated in each vaccination center

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications

*From the specifications document:*
> No duplicate entries should be possible for the same SNS user on the same day or vaccine period.

*From the client clarifications:*
> *Question:* Dear client, In the acceptance criteria, "the algorithm should run automatically at a time defined in a configuration file and should register a date, the name of the vaccination center and the total number of vaccinated users." How it is supposed to register this information? Should it be recorded in a file (ex: txt,..) or recorded in the system (ex: in a store) ?
>
> *Answer:* The data should be written to a CSV file (field delimiter should be a semicolon).

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

* *AC:* The algorithm should run automatically at a time defined in a configuration file and should register the date, the name of the vaccination center and the total number of vaccinated users.


### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

* No found dependencies


### 1.5 Input and Output Data

**Input Data:**

* Typed data:
    * Asks to see number of people vaccinated

* Output Data:
  * File with the number of people per day that were vaccinated in each center

# 4. Tests

# 5. Construction (Implementation)

## Class numberOfPeopleVaccinated

    public numberOfPeopleVaccinated(Date date, int nVaccinations, String vacCenterName, Company company){
        this.company= company;
        this.date = date;
        this.nVaccinations = nVaccinations;
        this.vacCenterName = vacCenterName;
    }
    public numberOfPeopleVaccinated(){
    }

    public static Date getDate() {
        return date;
    }

    public int getNVaccinations() {
        return nVaccinations;
    }

    public String getVacCenterName() {
        return vacCenterName;
    }

    public int saveNumberOfPeopleVaccinatedPerCenter(numberOfPeopleVaccinated numberVaccinations) {
        VacCenterController vacc = new VacCenterController(company);
        return vacc.fullSNSUserVaccination().size();
    }

# 6. Integration and Demo
* There is a nem SD added to the program, which is a requirement for the US, that is the timer.
