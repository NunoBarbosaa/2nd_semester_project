# US2: As a receptionist at one vaccination center, I want to schedule a vaccination

## 1. Requirements Engineering


### 1.1. User Story Description

As a receptionist at one vaccination center, I want to schedule a vaccination


### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications

*From the specifications document:*
> No duplicate entries should be possible for the same SNS user on the same day or vaccine period.

*From the client clarifications:*
> *Question:* "Question: When a receptionist schedules a vaccination for an SNS user, should they be presented with a list of available vaccines (brands, that meet acceptance criteria) from which to choose? Or should the application suggest only one?"
>
> *Answer:* The receptionist do not select the vaccine brand.When the user is at the vaccination center to take the vaccine, the nurse selects the vaccine. In Sprint D we will introduce new USs where the nurse records the administration of a vaccine to a SNS user.
-
> *Question:* "When the chosen vaccination center is a Community Mass Vaccination Center(CMVC), it will provide only one vaccine type to be scheduled. However, vaccine type is not an atributte of CMVC. Are we allowed to create an attribute of vaccine type in CMVC object?"
>
> *Answer:* Please study ESOFT and discuss this issue with ESOFT teachers.
