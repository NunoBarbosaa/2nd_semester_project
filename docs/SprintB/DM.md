# OO Analysis #

The construction process of the domain model is based on the client specifications, especially the nouns (for _concepts_) and verbs (for _relations_) used. 

## Rationale to identify domain conceptual classes ##
To identify domain conceptual classes, start by making a list of candidate conceptual classes inspired by the list of categories suggested in the book "Applying UML and Patterns: An Introduction to Object-Oriented Analysis and Design and Iterative Development". 


### _Conceptual Class Category List_ ###

**Business Transactions**

* Vaccinate SNSUser and give him certificate

---

**Transaction Line Items**

* Vaccine
* DGS Vaccination Certificate

---

**Product/Service related to a Transaction or Transaction Line Item**

*  Vaccination Process

---


**Transaction Records**

*  SNSUser Vaccine Schedules

---  


**Roles of People or Organizations**

* Nurse
* Receptionist
* Coordinator
* Administrator
* SNSUser


---


**Places**

*  VaccinationCenter

---

**Noteworthy Events**

* Vaccination Process
* Time interval between vaccinations
* Recovery period after vaccination

---


**Physical Objects**

* Vaccine

---


**Descriptions of Things**

*  


---


**Catalogs**

*  Vaccine Types and Vaccines

---


**Containers**

*  Vaccine contains a dosage

---


**Elements of Containers**

*  Dosage

---


**Organizations**

*  

---

**Other External/Collaborating Systems**

*  


---


**Records of finance, work, contracts, legal matters**

* 

---


**Financial Instruments**

*  

---


**Documents mentioned/used to perform some work/**

* 
---



###**Rationale to identify associations between conceptual classes**###

An association is a relationship between instances of objects that indicates a relevant connection and that is worth of remembering, or it is derivable from the List of Common Associations: 

+ **_Administrator_** manages **_Employee_**
+ **_Administrator_** manages **_Vaccine_**
+ **_Administrator_** manages **_VaccinationCenter_**
+ **_Administrator_** manages **_VaccineType_**
+ **_Administrator_** registers new **_SNSUser_**
+ **_Nurse_** is a part of **_Employee_**
+ **_Nurse_** updates **_SNSUser_**
+ **_Nurse_** updates **_VaccinationProcess_**
+ **_Coordinator_** monitors **_VaccinationProcess_**
+ **_VaccinationCenter_** has only one **_Coordinator_**
+ **_VaccinationCenter_** has multiple **_Employee_**
+ **_VaccinationCenter_** has multiple **_Schedule_**
+ **_VaccinationCenter_** has multiple **_SNSUser_**
+ **_Receptionist_** is a part of **_Employee_**
+ **_Receptionist_** updates **_VaccinationCenter_**
+ **_Receptionist_** creates new **_Schedule_**
+ **_Coordinator_** is a part of **_Employee_**
+ **_SNSUser_** has **_Vaccine_**
+ **_SNSUser_** creates **_Schedule_**
+ **_VaccineType_** has multiple **_Vaccine_**
+ **_VaccineType_** is in multiple **_Schedule_**
+ **_Vaccine_** has a **_VaccinationProcess_**
+ **_VaccinationProcess_** has multiple **_AgeGroup_**
+ **_AgeGroup_** has multiple **_Dose_**
+ **_AgeGroup_** is associated to **_TimeInterval_**
